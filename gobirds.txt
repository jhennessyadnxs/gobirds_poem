Go Birds
In the trenches of the Linc
By: Copilot

Steel cleats strike like bayonets,
mud-slicked turf, no room for regrets.
The line holds firm, the pocket breaks—
this is no game. This is what it takes.

The call goes out: a silent code,
eleven men in battle mode.
No mercy shown, no quarter asked,
each down a war, each play a task.

The crowd’s a storm, a cannon’s roar,
they’ve seen the blood, they beg for more.
From Kelly green to midnight shade,
this city’s soul is warrior-made.

Hurts leads the charge, eyes cold as steel,
Swift cuts through like a sharpened wheel.
The trenches groan, the helmets clash,
and hope ignites with every smash.

No poets here, just battered hands,
just broken ribs and battered stands.
But still they rise, through pain and dirt—
for Philly’s pride, for every hurt.

So raise the flag, let rivals learn:
you come to Philly, you don’t return.
We fight, we bleed, we never yield—
Go Birds. Our oath. Our field.
